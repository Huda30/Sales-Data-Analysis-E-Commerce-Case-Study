# *Project Overview*🛍🛒

E-commerce like Amazon, eBay and other online platforms create a huge amount of data daily.
My job as a data analyst was to manipulate different kinds of data and leverage them to come up with beautiful, and insightful information.

The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases, categorized by Order ID, Product, Price, Product Type, Order Date, and Purchase Address.

There are also challenges that I have addressed using my technical skills, demonstrated by the following challenge:

* Which is the best month for sale?

* Which city has the max order?

* What product sold the most & Why?

* Understanding the Trend of the most sold product.

* What products are most often sold together?
